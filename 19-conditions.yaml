# The line when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat" in the script is a conditional statement that ensures the associated task is executed only if the target system's operating system family is RedHat.

# Breakdown of the Script:
# ansible_os_family:
# This is a built-in Ansible fact that identifies the OS family of the target system.

# Common values include:
# "RedHat": Includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, etc.
# "Debian": Includes Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
# "Suse", "Gentoo", "Windows", etc., for other OS families.

# when Statement:
# The when clause is used in Ansible to apply a conditional filter. Tasks are executed only if the condition evaluates to true.
